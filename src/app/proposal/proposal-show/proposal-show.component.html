         Hi {{ proposal.customer }},</p>

         <p>It was a pleasure meeting with you and reviewing your project requirements. I believe it is a great fit. for the type of projects that I build out. Please feel free to check out my work <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}">here</a>.</p>

       <p>To succesfully buld out the application I will be utilizing {{ proposal.tools }}, and a number of tools to ensure that the project follows industry wide practices.</p>

       <p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to encorporating everything we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard, and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have
         a trascript view of the development as it takes place.</p>

       <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements we discussed, I am estimating that it will take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to complete. This project should take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks and with my hourly
         rate of {{ proposal.hourly_rate }}, the estimated total will be {{ proposal.estimated_hours * proposal.hourly_rate | currency:'USD':true:'.0' }}.</p>

       <p>
         The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts.
       </p>
       <p>
         I am excited to be working with you and build out this project.
